library(ETLSyntheaBuilder)

# We are loading a version 5.4 CDM into a local PostgreSQL database called "synthea10".
# The ETLSyntheaBuilder package leverages the OHDSI/CommonDataModel package for CDM creation.
# Valid CDM versions are determined by executing CommonDataModel::listSupportedVersions().
# The strings representing supported CDM versions are currently "5.3" and "5.4". 
# The Synthea version we use in this example is 2.7.0.
# However, at this time we also support 3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.2.0 and 3.3.0.
# Please note that Synthea's MASTER branch is always active and this package will be updated to support
# future versions as possible.
# The schema to load the Synthea tables is called "native".
# The schema to load the Vocabulary and CDM tables is "cdm_synthea10".  
# The username and pw are "postgres" and "lollipop".
# The Synthea and Vocabulary CSV files are located in /tmp/synthea/output/csv and /tmp/Vocabulary_20181119, respectively.

# For those interested in seeing the CDM changes from 5.3 to 5.4, please see: http://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54Changes.html
